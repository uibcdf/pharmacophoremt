# Required Python 3.14 adoption

## What

The suite maintainer requires Python 3.11–3.14 from every Python member under
uibcdf/molsyssuite#51 and immutable `policy-v1.5.3`. Inspected source `95b0bfe706d4080826862c5bdf00285622509d38`
still excluded 3.14. This record separates required adoption from scientific
qualification and public delivery.

## How

Metadata, contributor instructions, required full CI, applicable recipe and
installed-candidate matrices now cover `>=3.11,<3.15`. Routine development
stays on 3.13. Recovery requires successful **executed** Linux full tests on
all four minors before advancing its watermark. PR/internal-push schedules
and all existing scientific assertions/test selection are preserved.

The new 3.14 lane uses the existing controlled-source mechanism, with MolSysMT
`3eb5afd1de087f775b78d7fa45ad69cca3a02d43` and MolSysViewer `ec4c71e574d798b7c8675b7e7e983da878ce9889` (metadata inspected to admit 3.14;
the suite transition records their qualified source pair). Older minors keep
their prior source revisions. Where needed, the 3.14 environment keeps the
3.13 scientific dependency surface and uses published Pytest Receptor 1.1.0.
These source routes remain test evidence, not publicly delivered closure;
replace them after reviewed compatible public packages are independently
installed. Do not bypass Requires-Python.

## Why

Old provider revisions cap Python below 3.14, so changing only the consumer
bound would leave ordinary installation blocked. A three-minor matrix must
not clear the new required four-minor CI debt.

## What is measured and what is assumed

Source metadata, exact provider bounds, existing CI and prior recipe/resource
gates have been inspected. New solver, installation and full-test outcomes
are recorded as obtained; configuration alone proves none of them.

## Alternatives and refuted paths

Metadata overrides and tolerated/skipped scientific failures cannot establish
support. Replacing older-minor dependency generations globally would expand
the compatibility surface unnecessarily; the new route is scoped to 3.14.

## Scope and exclusions

Governance and ecosystem compatibility only. Scientific defects remain with
the owning component team and are neither suppressed nor fixed here. Source
configuration does not authorize public upload or a delivered-support badge.

## Acceptance criteria

- Coherent four-minor metadata/recipe/full-CI/installed-artifact contract.
- Ordinary installed 3.14 import and full relevant tests, or concrete owned
  blockers that preserve actual failure and bounded pending adoption.
- Historical three-minor evidence cannot clear skipped-CI debt.
- Candidate/channel and fresh public clean-install evidence precede admission.

The recovery regression is
`tests/test_ci_backlog.py::test_a_previous_three_minor_matrix_cannot_clear_314_debt`.

### Test-results publisher condition inspected on 2026-10-03

Expanding the matrix exposed an existing malformed mixed expression in the
test-results upload condition. Actionlint reported that surrounding text made the
condition always true. The complete condition is now one GitHub expression,
retaining test-results publication only from Linux/Python 3.13 after failed tests
as well as successful tests, unless the run is cancelled. Python 3.14 cells
run the suite without publishing additional test-results uploads. The separate
coverage report publisher was already correctly scoped to Linux/Python 3.13.

### Qualification checkpoint — 2026-10-03

Source `9c67ee26ef62bd2375f61f87d772e312a6b595cb`: [CI run 37105628282](https://github.com/uibcdf/pharmacophoremt/actions/runs/37105628282).
Reporting governance and all eight full scientific jobs pass, including
ordinary installation, off-checkout import and actual interpreter/architecture
checks. Public noarch candidate/channel qualification remains component-owned.

Main now retains strict PR protection with 10 checks, adding Linux and
macOS ARM Python 3.14 to the prior checks. Existing administrator bypass for
internal direct pushes is preserved. Source feasibility is recorded centrally
as `authorized`, not public `admitted` support; the badge remains unchanged.
A documentary skipped push must remain visible to nightly recovery.
